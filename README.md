# Twitter-sentiment-analysis-with-mood-light
A Project which conducts sentiment analysis of tweets and classifies the sentiment as Positive, Negative or Neutral.It connects to the Twitter API using Python.
Based on a search term, it calculates the the mood by conducting sentiment analysis on tweets of that search term, and uses this data to generate Red(Negative), Green(Positive) and Blue(Neutral) 
values for a colour which are then transmitted to the Arduino via Serial communication and used to change the colour of an R,G,B LED to depict the mood of Twitter in real time.
